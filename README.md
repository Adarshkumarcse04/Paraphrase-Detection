# Paraphrase-Detection
Checks the semantic similarity

This project implements a paraphrase detection system using a fine-tuned version of Sentence-BERT (SBERT). The model takes in two sentences as input and computes a semantic similarity score between 0 and 1, where values closer to 1 indicate higher likelihood of the sentences being paraphrases.

By leveraging SBERTâ€™s ability to generate high-quality sentence embeddings, this system provides an efficient way to measure semantic overlap between text pairs. Such a capability is useful in a variety of natural language processing applications, including duplicate question detection, semantic search, information retrieval, and text clustering.
